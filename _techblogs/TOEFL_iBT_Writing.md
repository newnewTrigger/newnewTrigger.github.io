# TOEFL-iBT Session 4: Writing

## Overview

There are two tasks in TOEFL Writing Session: the **Integrated Writing** and **Academic Discussion**. Their basic information, including time span and focuses, is as followed:

- **Integrated Writing**: 
    - takes about 25 minutes: 3 min only for reading a material, about 3 min only for listening to another material, and 20 min for writing an article

- **Academic Discussion**:
    - takes 10 minutes: read the material and write your article

Still, Writing session isn't completely apart from other sessions, for catching basic information from the reading & listening materials are essential as well. Therefore, we will share with you some skills to help you catch the points more efficiently, especially in the listening part.

Also, we will give **one** useful structure for the first task, and **three** useful structure for the second task.

## Integrated Writing

After finishing your note, use this structure to complete your article:


> We can learn from the reading that <u>`R Fact`</u>. Three theories are proposed in the reading <u>`R Points`</u>, while all of them are refuted by the lecture, which states that <u>`L Points`</u>.
> First, the reading claims that <u>`R1 Point`</u>, as <u>`R1 Elaboration`</u>. However, the lecture does not agree with the idea and claims that <u>`L1 Point and Elaboration`</u>.
> Second, the reading indicates that <u>`R2 Point`</u>, which is reflected by <u>`R2 Elaboration`</u>. Nevertheless, the lecture counteracts the idea: <u>`L2 Point and Elaboration`</u>.
> Third, the reading demonstrates that <u>`R3 Point`</u>, since <u>`R3 Elaboration`</u>. Still, the lectures argues against such opinion â€” <u>`L3 Point and Elaboration`</u>.

## Academic Discussion


> I believe <u>`Opinion`</u>, since <u>`Elaboration`</u>.
> To be more specific, <u>`Further Elaboration`</u>.
> For example, <u>`Example`</u>.
> Still, some might claim that <u>`Opposite Opinion`</u>. However, <u>`Argument`</u>.
