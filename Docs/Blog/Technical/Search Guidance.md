# This is a primary guidance to help you search for items quicker, and more percise.
`Announcement: The following techniques are available universally, no matter what search engine you use.`
## 1. Ambiguous & Percise  
Beginners always straightly type in what they want to search on the engine, but soon get annoyed-- such move often give out the wrong thing. They find that the engine seperate the information in pieces and search respectively, instead of search for the whole, percise expression.  
This is because you're in the mode `Ambiguous Search`, where search engines don't strictly search for the given information in a whole. Such searching method can be applyed when you're not confident about your information, or you wish to search with several key words. In the latter case, you should seperate the words with blanks as well.   
To apply the `Percise Search` mode, we can use `" "` to block your information, then the engine will know that you wish for a percise searching practice.

## 2. Locate the information
Sometimes, we know the site we want has the key information on the top
    
## 3. Specific Websites  
Append `site:[website]` to your key informations. Replace the [website] into whatever you like.
> Causious: the ultimate exprssion don't include `[]` and the blank.

## 4. File Types


## 5. I don't want to see this
If you want a search without some key elements, use the expression `-[key words]`. Replace the [key words] with anything you don't want to see.

## 6. I have to see this
Similarly, you can use `+[key words]` to ask the engine to serve you with the key words.
